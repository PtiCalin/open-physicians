# Project Overview

Open Physicians focuses on building a reproducible, open-source pipeline that consolidates licensing data, specialties, and practice locations for physicians worldwide. The initiative prioritizes verifiability, adherence to local regulations, and transparent documentation of each transformation step.

## Goals

2. Offer a minimal but extensible ETL pipeline
3. Document source provenance, refresh cadence, and known limitations
4. Encourage community validations and contributions
